# QNX-GTK2-3
converted an existing qnx gtk2 theme to work with gtk3

Original gtk2 theme: https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1079046/

Matching as closely as I can withing the limitations of GTK3. e.g tabs and window backgrounds for windows with tabs.

Download amd place in .themes folder in your home directory. Use whatever application/tweak tool your DE uses to set themes or install lxappearance and set you theme from there.
