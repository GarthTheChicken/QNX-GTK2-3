# QNX-GTK2-3
converted an existing qnx gtk2 theme to work with gtk3

Original gtk2 theme: https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1079046/

Matching as closely as I can withing the limitations of GTK3. e.g tabs and window backgrounds for windows with tabs.

Download amd place in .themes folder in your home directory. Use whatever application/tweak tool your DE uses to set themes or install lxappearance and set you theme from there.

The not needed folder contains some additional metacity qnx theme colors that along with the metacity-1 folder came with the original gtk2 theme. As I'm using sawfish as my window manager I'm including them here for backup in case anyone does use them.
